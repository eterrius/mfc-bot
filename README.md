# mfc-bot, Discord Bot for MFC

Hello! This is a mini project that I have created to help out with the understaffed MFC team, which I hope that this bot can help to reduce some of the workload we have.

This bot mainly focus on automating the process of submitting the requests of new MFC matches, where specified participants will also automatically receive a new role for pings on each updates of their match.


## Usage

*TBC*


## Installation

We currently do not support using the bot from outside of the server itself, as you need to be in the MFC server to matchmake anyways. However, if you want to do something similar, this code *may/may not* (idk monarck do you want this to be public) be open-source 

*TBC*
